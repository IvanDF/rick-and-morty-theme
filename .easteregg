## 🎉 Secret Features Unlocked!

You've discovered the hidden easter egg file! As a reward, here are some secret tips:

### 🔐 Hidden Color Codes

Did you know these colors have special meanings?

- `#5ce65c` - Portal green: The RGB values (92, 230, 92) add up to 414, which is 137 + 277!
- `#00d4ff` - Mr. Meeseeks blue: Hex code spells "OO D4 FF" (Oh! Da! Free!)
- `#ffd54f` - Mega Seeds: The hex ends in 4F (79 in decimal, Rick's age!)

### 🎭 Secret Token Names You Might Have Missed

1. **"Noob Noob"** - For italic text (God damn!)
2. **"Simple Rick's Wafer"** - JSON keys (Made from Simple Rick's memories)
3. **"Zigerion Simulation"** - Code blocks (Fake reality check!)
4. **"Cronenberg World"** - Regex patterns (Chaotic pattern matching)
5. **"Unity Hivemind"** - Python decorators (Collective function enhancement)

### 🎪 Try These Secret Code Patterns

Type these exact variable names to see special colors:

```javascript
// Secret pattern #1: The Sacred Trinity
const wubba = "Wubba";
const lubba = "Lubba";
const dubDub = "Dub Dub";

// Secret pattern #2: Dimension Array
const C137 = true;
const dimensions = [137, 131, 132];

// Secret pattern #3: The Pickle
const pickle = "Rick";  // Funniest shit ever

// Secret pattern #4: Mr. Meeseeks Box
const summon = (meeseeks) => "Look at me!";

// Secret pattern #5: Portal Coordinates
const x = 137;
const y = 420;  // Nice
const z = 42;   // Hitchhiker's Guide reference!
```

### 🎬 Hidden Features in the Theme

#### Feature #1: Semantic Color Shift
Variables change color slightly based on their scope! Try declaring the same variable name in different scopes.

#### Feature #2: Rainbow Brackets
With bracket pair colorization enabled, you get interdimensional bracket colors:
- Level 1: Portal Green
- Level 2: Mr. Meeseeks Blue  
- Level 3: Mega Seeds Yellow
- Level 4+: Cycles through!

#### Feature #3: Git Status Colors
- **Untracked files**: Mr. Meeseeks Blue (new and helpful!)
- **Modified files**: Portal Green (ready to jump through!)
- **Deleted files**: Rick's Flask Red (gone, but not forgotten)
- **Ignored files**: Faded (in another dimension)

### 🔊 Sound Effects (DIY)

While the theme doesn't include sounds, you can set up your own!

1. Install the "Sound Effects" extension
2. Add these custom sounds:
   - **File save**: Portal opening sound
   - **Error**: Rick's "Aw jeez"
   - **Success**: "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!"
   - **Git commit**: Portal closing sound

### 🎪 Pro Secrets

#### Secret #1: Multi-cursor Magic
Hold `Option/Alt` and click to create multiple cursors - it's like having multiple Mortys helping you code!

#### Secret #2: Column Selection
Hold `Option+Shift` and drag - select in columns like opening a vertical portal!

#### Secret #3: Quick File Navigation
`Cmd+P` then type `@` to see symbols - instant teleportation within files!

#### Secret #4: Zen Mode Custom
In Zen Mode (`Cmd+K Z`), the theme really shines - you're in your own pocket dimension!

#### Secret #5: Custom Window Title
Set your window title to show what you're working on:
```json
{
  "window.title": "⚡ ${dirty}${activeEditorShort} | Project: ${rootName} | Dimension C-137 ⚡"
}
```

### 🎁 Bonus: Theme Philosophy

The theme was designed with these principles:

1. **137 (C-137)** - Rick's dimension number appears everywhere
2. **High Contrast** - So your eyes don't get Cronenberged
3. **Semantic Colors** - Different meaning = different color
4. **Portal Fluid Physics** - Green flows naturally, blue provides structure
5. **Comic Relief** - Easter eggs make coding fun!
